<p>Go raibh maith agat as cuairt a thabhairt ar mo gréasáin - <i>Thanks for visiting my website.</i></p>

<p>Is mise Éanna Ó Ceallaigh. Is innealtóir Éireannach mé.</p>

<p>If you've never heard of a word of the Irish language before, don't worry. It's easy once you know the rules.</p>

<p>My name is Éanna - ee-ah-na - like the name Ian with an <i>ahh</i> at the end.</p>

<p>Ó Ceallaigh - oh-kah-lee - is the original Irish version of Kelly or O'Kelly.</p>

<p>I'm just an engineer - <i>innealtóir</i> - writing about technology related problems I've solved in my work and personal life, mainly focusing on Azure and Kubernetes.</p>
